# Styles 

Some of the common colours have been assigned as a variable to make it comfortable to be used.

  Images are stored in images folder which were provided within the course.

# This is a replica of the exact same project as made in course but it wasnt made responsive. 
      so, the responsive deisgn was made by me .


# Comments have been made in both HTml and CSS file to separate all the sections , font import  , Variables and Dots used .

# Code is different as taught in course because this website is mainly created by using the flexbox property and em and re units .
